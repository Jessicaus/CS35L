1. Since the statement is in the source files, I first used `grep -n "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information" *` to find where the line existed. It returned:
northamerica:883:# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

2. Then I used `git log -S"Even newspaper reports present contradictory information"` to find the differences that change the number of occurrences of this string (such that I can know the history of this when it first came into being). This gives me:

Later I used `git log -S"Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." --pretty=fuller` to give me further information

So actually the line was created by Arthur David Olson on December 21 11:43:42, 1995 (-0500), but it was committed in 2012 by Eggert probably because git doesn't exist back then, and Eggert added this history to the git-based version of tzdb.

3. I went to that original information which introduces the line, and wrote `git blame c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b northamerica | grep -n "Even newspaper reports present"`, which gives me:
285:c12b43274 (Arthur David Olson 1995-12-21 11:43:42 -0500  285) # and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
This tells me at the time it is line 285 that was added, but now it is line 883 in the northamerica file.
