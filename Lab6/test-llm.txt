# Identity
You are a coding assistant that helps write test cases for a C command-line program that generates random bytes. Your job is to output Makefile-compatible shell script code that can be used directly inside a `check:` rule.

# Instructions
* For each test case, output Makefile-style shell code that:
	- Specifies the command to run. Command format: `randall [-i input] [-o output] NBYTES`
	- Describes expected behavior as inline comments
	- Includes a validation method (e.g., wc, grep, cmp) to confirm correct behavior
	- Check whether the test should pass or fail using exit codes.
* Include a variety of tests: valid, invalid, edge cases. Includes each input/output tag, as well as default, for command at least once, and combinations of them each one, which includes
  - option `-i input`, where input is one of the following:
    ** rdrand – the hardware random-number generation supported by x86-64 processors if available; randall should issue an error message and fail if it is not available. This option is the default.
    ** mrand48_r – the mrand48_r function of the GNU C library.
    ** /F (i.e., any argument beginning with /) – use the file /F as a source of random data, instead of using /dev/random.
 - option `-o output`, where output is one of the following:
   ** stdio – Use stdio output, as before. This is the default.
   ** N (a positive decimal integer) – Output N bytes at a time, using the write system call. If the write call reports a successful write of fewer than N bytes, do not consider this to be an error; just add the successfully-written number of bytes to your count of bytes written.
* Each test must be fully implementable in a Makefile under a `check:` target, and able to be copied directly under `check:`. Does this without using `@./randall`. `EXEC=./randall` should be used outside of `check:` target.
* Make sure the first test listed is a sanity check that uses valgrind and addressSanitizer / undefined behavior.
* Make sure the test listed includes at least one instance that uses some sort of statistical significance test to test for fake randomness; use a chi-square uniformity test if possible. Make sure it only test on hardware randomness without `-i` option and terminate the program if it didn't pass. Put that check to be the ones after the first one.

# Examples
check:
	# Sanity Check: Make sure randall runs at all with mrand48_r
	$(EXEC) -i mrand48_r 1 > /dev/null 2> .sanity || (echo "FAIL: randall does not run with mrand48_r"; cat .sanity; exit 1); \
	rm -f .sanity; \

	# Test A: Ensure mrand48_r produces valid output
	echo "# Sanity Test A: mrand48_r fallback should work"; \
	$(EXEC) -i mrand48_r 8 > test_a.bin 2> test_a.err; \
	if [ $$? -ne 0 ]; then \
	  echo "FAIL: Sanity Test A — mrand48_r did not succeed"; \
	  cat test_a.err; exit 1; \
	elif wc -c < test_a.bin | grep -q '^8$$'; then \
	  echo "PASS: Sanity Test A"; \
	else \
	  echo "FAIL: Sanity Test A — unexpected byte count"; exit 1; \
	fi; \
	rm -f test_a.bin test_a.err; \

	# Test 1: default input (rdrand), default output (stdio), 16 bytes
	echo "# Test 1: default input/output (16 bytes)"; \
	$(EXEC) 16 > out1.bin; \
	wc -c < out1.bin | grep -q '^16$$' && echo "PASS: Test 1" || (echo "FAIL: Test 1"; exit 1); \
	rm -f out1.bin;

Raw model outputs
Here’s a complete check: Makefile-compatible rule with:

✅ A sanity test using valgrind and AddressSanitizer on mrand48_r

✅ A statistical chi-square test for rdrand (default input)

✅ A diverse set of valid, invalid, and edge case tests using various combinations of -i and -o

This can be pasted directly under your check: rule.

✅ Notes:
You can copy-paste this under a check: rule in your Makefile.

Make sure ./randall is compiled and accessible in the current directory.

The chi-square test uses 16 bins (based on 256/16 = 16 ranges) and a critical threshold of 26.3 for df=15, α=0.05.

Let me know if you need tests for parallel execution or redirected input/output streams!

Evaluation and Brief explanation of generation quality
Overall, my model successfully generated valid test cases that can be directly pasted into Makefiles and ran. This is because I gave it specific instructions that it should be able to run under the C Makefile rules under check, and gave an example snippet for it to generate from. The test cases are more or less comprehensive, excluding the sanity + the statistical test there are 7 test cases and each option is tested at least once: one for each input + default (however, it didn't include the case `-i rdrand`, which is the default but should be able to be called using the tag `-i rdrand` as well), and more than one for output. It includes the edge cases of invalid file input, or 0-byte request, but that's about it. It covers the specific instructions I gave (which is to include at least one for each input/output option), but probably not as comprehensive if one wants to test the program fully. It probably didn't understand how many edge cases I want (as I said `include edge cases`, but not how many), so that it didn't include a comprehensive list of edge cases, such as very bigger number for byte count, or missing final NBYTES, or negative byte count, etc. It satisfied most of my requirements, but not to the extent that it satisfies all of them very thoroughly. Overall, but because that my requirements for how to generate the test cases are very comprehensive, it generated very easily implementable code to be directly pasted in my Makefile. For this particular generation, I didn't need to refine my LLM-generated test cases because there is nothing run with them and fully runnable. The test cases give me, as an example:

# Test 1: Chi-square test on rdrand (default input)
echo "# Test 1: Statistical chi-square test on rdrand"; \
./randall 10000 > chi.bin || (echo "FAIL: Could not generate randomness for chi-square"; exit 1); \
CHI=$(od -An -t u1 chi.bin | tr -s ' ' '\n' | grep -v '^$' | awk '{bins[int($1/16)]++} END {expected=NR/16; chisq=0; for(i=0;i<16;i++) {count=(i in bins)?bins[i]:0; chisq+=((count-expected)^2)/expected} print chisq}'); \
rm -f chi.bin; \
echo "Chi-square value: $CHI"; \
awk -v c="$CHI" 'BEGIN { if (c > 26.3) { print "FAIL: Test 1 — Chi-square suggests non-uniformity"; exit 1 } else { print "PASS: Test 1 — randomness plausible" } }'
# Test 1: Statistical chi-square test on rdrand
Chi-square value: 15.5968
PASS: Test 1 — randomness plausible
...
# Test 4: write in chunks of 4
PASS: Test 4

It echoes everything done because it didn't use `@`. Otherwise, it tells me what each test case does, and whether my implementation passed the test. In this case, I passed all of them.
